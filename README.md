# Teaching Tools

A set of tools that are used to help make writing and grading assignments easier, currently with a focus on Canvas-based grading.

Note, I have broken this repo up into two different repos, listed below.
- [Autograder](https://github.com/OtterDen-Lab/Autograder)
- [QuizGenerator](https://github.com/OtterDen-Lab/QuizGenerator)
